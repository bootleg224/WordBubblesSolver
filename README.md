# WordBubblesSolver

I was annoyed at the iPhone game Word Bubbles, so I wanted to write a quick solver for fun
I used code from here: dotnetperls.com/word-search and modified it to account for holes in the graph

The solution then outputs to text from the web, or if replying to an SMS (via twilio) it returns the first 1600 characters worth of solution
